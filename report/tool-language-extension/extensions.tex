\section{Possible Extension}

\textnormal{We planned to add the possibility to call a statement simply with
  the expression, without using 'do(...)', and the possibility to call a method
  for the 'self' object without 'this'. We guessed that it was possible to
  implement these features keeping our grammar in LL1. It appeared that it was
  not possible and that these updates needed another grammar. }

\textnormal{One possibility for this is to encapsulate a specific non-LL1
  grammar for the cases which brakes LL1 property (simple statement, expression
  terminaison). The parser should have the possibility to call the 2nd grammar
  only when it needed, and keep using LL1 grammar otherwise. }
